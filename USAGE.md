## Run sick_scan_xd driver

The sick_scan_xd driver can be started on the command line by `sick_generic_caller <launchfile> [hostname:=<ip-address>]`. The start process varies slightly depending on the target OS:

- On native Linux without ROS, call

    ```sick_generic_caller <launchfile>```

- On Linux with ROS-1, call

    ```roslaunch sick_scan <launchfile>```

- On Linux with ROS-2, call

    ```ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/<launchfile>```

- On native Windows without ROS, call

    ```sick_generic_caller <launchfile>```

- On Windows with ROS-2, call

    ```ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/<launchfile>```

- For Multiscan130 (sick_scansegement_xd):
    * Linux native:   `sick_generic_caller sick_scansegment_xd.launch hostname:=<ip-address> udp_receiver_ip:=<ip-address>`
    * Linux ROS-1:    `roslaunch sick_scan sick_scansegment_xd.launch hostname:=<ip-address> udp_receiver_ip:=<ip-address>`
    * Linux ROS-2:    `ros2 launch sick_scan sick_scansegment_xd.launch.py hostname:=<ip-address> udp_receiver_ip:=<ip-address>`
    * Windows native: `sick_generic_caller sick_scansegment_xd.launch hostname:=<ip-address> udp_receiver_ip:=<ip-address>`
    * Windows ROS-2:  `ros2 launch sick_scan sick_scansegment_xd.launch.py hostname:=<ip-address> udp_receiver_ip:=<ip-address>`
    * `hostname` is the ip-address of the lidar, `udp_receiver_ip` is the ip-address of the receiver (i.e. the ip of the computer running sick_generic_caller).

Common commandline options are

- `hostname:=<ip-address>` to connect to a sensor with a given IP address. Default value is always the factory default IP address of the scanner.

Further (common and scanner specific) options can be set via launchfile, see [Common parameters](#common-parameters) and configure the settings in the launchfile corresponding to the scanner type.

Note: After modifying a launch-file, it has to be installed by running `catkin_make_isolated --install --cmake-args -DROS_VERSION=1 -Wno-dev`
to be located and used by `roslaunch`.

On ROS-2 you can launch sick_generic_caller by python-launchfiles, too. Use
```
ros2 launch sick_scan <name>.launch.py <param>:=<value>
```
E.g. for LMS-5xx: `ros2 launch sick_scan sick_lms_5xx.launch.py hostname:=192.168.0.1`

The launch.py-files on ROS-2 passes the corresponding launch-file to the driver: [sick_lms_5xx.launch.py](launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch.py) gives an example for LMS-5xx. Parameter can be overwritten
* either by commandline, e.g. <br/> `ros2 launch sick_scan sick_lms_5xx.launch.py hostname:=192.168.0.1`, 
* or by passing additional arguments in the launch.py-file, e.g. <br/> `node = Node(package='sick_scan', executable='sick_generic_caller', arguments=[launch_file_path, 'hostname:=192.168.0.1'])`


### Start Multiple Nodes

Multiple nodes can be started to support multiple sensors. In this case, multiple instances of sick_scan have to be started, each node with different name and topic. ROS-1 example to run two TiM 7xx devices with ip address `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.0.2`:

```
roslaunch sick_scan sick_tim_7xx.launch nodename:=sick_tim_7xx_1 hostname:=192.168.0.1 cloud_topic:=cloud_1 &
roslaunch sick_scan sick_tim_7xx.launch nodename:=sick_tim_7xx_2 hostname:=192.168.0.2 cloud_topic:=cloud_2 &
```

On Linux with ROS-1, multiple nodes to support multiple sensors can be started by one launch file, too.
Take the launchfile [sick_tim_5xx_twin.launch](launch/sick_tim_5xx_twin.launch) as an example.
Remapping the scan and cloud topics is essential to distinguish the scandata and provide TF information.

ROS-2 example to run two TiM 7xx devices with ip address `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.0.2`:

```
ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/sick_tim_7xx.launch nodename:=sick_tim_7xx_1 hostname:=192.168.0.1 cloud_topic:=cloud_1 &
ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/sick_tim_7xx.launch nodename:=sick_tim_7xx_2 hostname:=192.168.0.2 cloud_topic:=cloud_2 &
```

### Common parameters

For the launch-file settings and the tag/values pairs the following keywords are supported:

| Keyword      |     Meaning     |  Default value |    Hint       |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| scanner_type |  Scanner family |  ???           | see list above |
| min_ang      |  Start scan angle in [rad] |  -2.3998277           |  |
| max_ang      |  End scan angle in [rad] |  +2.3998277           |  |
| intensity_resolution_16bit | Switch between 8Bit/16Bit| "false" | do not change|
| hostname | Ip address of scanner  | 192.168.0.1 | change to scanner ip address in your network (see faq) |
| port | port number  | 2112 | do not change, check firewall rules if there is blocking traffic  |
| timelimit | Timelimit in [sec]   | 5 | do not change  |

- `scanner_type`
  Name of the used scanner. Usually this is also the name of the launch file. This entry is used to differentiate
  between the various scanner properties within the software code.

- `hostname`
  IP-address of the scanner (default: 192.168.0.1)

- `port`
  IP-port of the scanner (default: 2112)

- `min_ang`
  Start angle in [rad]

- `max_ang`
  End angle in [rad]

- `use_binary_protocol`
  Switch between SOPAS Binary and SOPAS ASCII protocol

- `intensity`
  Enable or disable transport of intensity values

- `intensity_resolution_16bit`
  If true, the intensity values is transferred as 16 bit value. If false, as 8 bit value.

- `min_intensity`
  If min_intensity > 0, all range values in a LaserScan message are set to infinity, if their intensity value is below min_intensity

- `cloud_topic`
  Topic name of the published pointcloud2 data

- `frame_id`
  Frame id used for the published data

Tag/value pairs of the commandline overwrite settings in the launch file.
The use of the parameters can be looked up in the launch files. This is also recommended as a starting point.

### Starting Scanner with Specific Ip Address

To start the scanner with a specific IP address, option `hostname:=<ip-address>` can be used.
The hostname is the ip-address of the scanner, e.g.
```
sick_generic_caller sick_tim_5xx.launch hostname:=192.168.0.71                      # Linux native
roslaunch sick_scan sick_tim_5xx.launch hostname:=192.168.0.71                      # Linux ROS-1
ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller sick_tim_5xx.launch hostname:=192.168.0.71   # Linux ROS-2
sick_generic_caller sick_tim_5xx.launch hostname:=192.168.0.71                      # Windows native
ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller sick_tim_5xx.launch hostname:=192.168.0.71   # Windows ROS-2
```

### Further useful parameters and features

- `timelimit`
  Timelimit in [sec] for max. wait time of incoming sensor reply

- `sw_pll_only_publish`
  If true, the internal Software PLL is fored to sync the scan generation time stamp to a system timestamp

- Angle compensation: For highest angle accuracy the NAV-Lidar series supports an [angle compensation mechanism](./doc/angular_compensation.md).

- **Field monitoring**: The **LMS1xx**, **LMS5xx**, **TiM7xx** and **TiM7xxS** families have [extended settings for field monitoring](./doc/field_monitoring_extensions.md).

- **Radar devices**: For radar devices (RMS-1xxx, RMS-3xx), radar raw targets or radar objects or both can be tracked and transmitted. You can activate parameter transmit_raw_targets, transmit_objects or both in the launchfile:
   ```
   <param name="transmit_raw_targets" type="bool" value="false"/>
   <param name="transmit_objects" type="bool" value="true"/>
   ```
   By default, radar objects are tracked.

- **Coordinate transform**: An optional coordinate transform can be applied to the pointcloud. See [coordinate transforms](./doc/coordinate_transforms.md) for details.

### ROS services

On ROS-1 and ROS-2, services can be used to send COLA commands to the sensor. This can be very helpful for diagnosis, e.g. by querying the device status or its id.

Use the following examples to run a cola commond on ROS-1:
```
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sMN IsSystemReady'}"
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sRN SCdevicestate'}"
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sEN LIDinputstate 1'}"
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sEN LIDoutputstate 1'}"
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sMN LMCstartmeas'}"
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/SCdevicestate "{}" # query device state
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/SCreboot "{}"      # execute a software reset on the device
rosservice call /sick_lms_5xx/SCsoftreset "{}"   # save current parameter and shut down device
```

Use the following examples to run a cola commond on ROS-2:
```
ros2 service call /ColaMsg sick_scan/srv/ColaMsgSrv "{request: 'sMN IsSystemReady'}"
ros2 service call /ColaMsg sick_scan/srv/ColaMsgSrv "{request: 'sRN SCdevicestate'}"
ros2 service call /ColaMsg sick_scan/srv/ColaMsgSrv "{request: 'sEN LIDinputstate 1'}"
ros2 service call /ColaMsg sick_scan/srv/ColaMsgSrv "{request: 'sEN LIDoutputstate 1'}"
ros2 service call /ColaMsg sick_scan/srv/ColaMsgSrv "{request: 'sMN LMCstartmeas'}"
ros2 service call /SCdevicestate sick_scan/srv/SCdevicestateSrv "{}" # query device state
ros2 service call /SCreboot sick_scan/srv/SCrebootSrv "{}"           # execute a software reset on the device
ros2 service call /SCsoftreset sick_scan/srv/SCsoftresetSrv "{}"     # save current parameter and shut down device
```

Use ros service `SickScanExit` to stop the scanner and driver:
```
rosservice call /sick_nav_3xx/SickScanExit "{}" # stop scanner and driver on ROS-1
ros2 service call /SickScanExit sick_scan/srv/SickScanExitSrv "{}" # stop scanner and driver on ROS-2
```

Note:
* The COLA commands are sensor specific. See the user manual and telegram listing for further details.
* ROS services require installation of ROS-1 or ROS-2, i.e. services for Cola commands are currently not supported on native Linux or native Windows.
* ROS services are currently not available for the LDMRS.
* Some SOPAS commands like `sMN SetAccessMode 3 F4724744` stop the current measurement. In this case, the driver restarts after a timeout (5 seconds by default). To process those SOPAS commands without restart, you can
   * send `sMN LMCstartmeas` and `sMN Run` to switch again into measurement mode within the timeout, or
   * increase the driver timeout `read_timeout_millisec_default` in the launch-file.

Example sequence with stop and start measurement to set a particle filter (TiM-7xxx on ROS-1):
```
rosservice call /sick_tim_7xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sMN SetAccessMode 3 F4724744'}"
rosservice call /sick_tim_7xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sRN LFPparticle'}" # response: "sRA LFPparticle \\x00\\x01\\xf4"
rosservice call /sick_tim_7xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sWN LFPparticle 0101F4'}" # response: "sWA LFPparticle"
rosservice call /sick_tim_7xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sMN LMCstartmeas'}"
rosservice call /sick_tim_7xx/ColaMsg "{request: 'sMN Run'}"
```

### Driver states, timeouts

The driver runs in two different states:

1. Initialization: The scanner is initialized and configured by a list of sopas commands

2. Measurement: The scanner is operational, scandata are transmitted and the point cloud is published.
After start, the driver enters initialization mode. After successful initialization, the driver switches automatically into measurement mode.

The communication between driver and scanner is monitored. In case of communication timeouts, e.g. due to network problems, the TCP connection is reset and the scanner is re-initialized. The driver uses 3 different timeouts (i.e time since last message received from lidar):

1. In measurement mode: If no messages arrive for 5 seconds [timeout 0], the TCP/IP connection is closed. After a short delay, the tcp connection is reopened and the driver switches to initialisation mode and reinitialises the Lidar.

2. In initialisation mode: If no messages received after 120 sec [Timeout 1] the TCP/IP connection is closed. After a short delay, the tcp connection is reopened and the driver switches to initialisation mode and reinitialises the Lidar.

3. In any mode: If no messages received after 150 sec [Timeout 2] the driver terminates.

Note: The internal timer is reset on successful communication. i.e. the timeout refers to the time of the last message from the Lidar. If there was no message yet, then the time of programme start is used.

All timeouts can be configured in the launchfile:
```

The following diagram shows the transition between the driver states:

![driverStatesDiagram](./doc/driverStatesDiagram1.png)

Note: Timeout 2 (i.e. no lidar message after 150 seconds) terminates the driver. By default, the driver does not restart automatically. It is therefor recommended to run the driver within an endless loop, e.g. in bash:

```
while(true) ; do roslaunch sick_scan <launchfile> [<arguments>] ; done
```

## Sopas Mode

This driver supports both COLA-B (binary) and COLA-A (ASCII) communication with the laser scanner. Binary mode is activated by default, since this mode generates less network traffic and enables more compatibility to all scanners.
If the communication mode set in the scanner memory is different from that used by the driver, the scanner's communication mode is changed. This requires a restart of the TCP-IP connection, which can extend the start time by up to 30 seconds.
There are two ways to prevent this:
1. Recommended:
   * Set the communication mode with the SOPAS ET software to binary and save this setting in the scanner's EEPROM.
   * Set "use_binary_protocol" to default value "true".
2. Use the parameter "use_binary_protocol" to overwrite the default settings of the driver.

## Tools

Various tools exist in the repository to improve the operation of the scanners. It is also recommended to read the following section "Troubleshooting".
Overview of the tools:

* Search for scanner in the network:
  Use the Python3 tool "sick_generic_device_finder.py" in the tools/sick_generic_device_finder directory.
  The tools will output the IP addresses of the connected scanners and some more information about the scanner.  
  Call it with python3, i.e.
  ``
  python3 sick_generic_device_finder.py
  ``
* Setting new IP address: With the help of the parameter "new_IP" a new IP address can be assigned when calling the node sick_scan.
  The launch file sick_new_ip.launch in the launch directory shows an example of how to use this parameter.
* Converting of pointclouds to images: With the tool pcl_converter.cpp one can convert pointcloud2-data
  to image. That is especial convenient for 24-layers scanners like the MRS6124.
* Setting up a brand new scanner: To set up a brand new scanner,
  it is recommended to use the two tools "sick_generic_device_finder.py" to find the scanner in the network
  and the launch file sick_new_ip.launch to set a new IP address. If further settings are to be saved that cannot be made via ROS   parameters, we recommend using the Windows tool "Sopas ET" from SICK.
* Unit tests: For a quick unit test after installation without the sensor hardware, a test server is provided to simulate a scanner. See [emulator](doc/emulator.md) for further details.
* Testing: The sick_scan_test program was developed for testing the driver. See [test/sick_scan_test.md](test/sick_scan_test.md) for details.

## Simulation

For unittests without sensor hardware, a simple test server is provided. To build the test server, call either cmake with option `-DCMAKE_ENABLE_EMULATOR=1`, or activate cmake option `ENABLE_EMULATOR` in CMakeLists.txt. Then rebuild sick_scan_xd. By default, option `ENABLE_EMULATOR` is switched off.

Please note that this just builds a simple test server for basic unittests of sick_scan_xd drivers. Its purpose is to run basic tests and to help with diagnosis in case of issues. It does not emulate a real scanner!

Simulation requires jsoncpp. Install with `sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev` on Linux and with `vcpkg install jsoncpp:x64-windows` on Windows.

You can find examples to test and run sick_scan_xd in offline mode in folder `test/scripts`. Their purpose is to demonstrate the usage of the sick_scan_xd driver. Please feel free to customize the scripts or use them as a starting point for own projects.

### Simulation on Windows

Run script `run_simu_lms_5xx.cmd` in folder `test/scripts` or execute the following commands:

1. Start the test server:
    ```
    cd .\build
    start "testserver" cmd /k python ../test/emulator/test_server.py --scandata_file=../test/emulator/scandata/20210302_lms511.pcapng.scandata.txt --scandata_frequency=20.0 --tcp_port=2112
    @timeout /t 1
    ```

2. Run sick_generic_caller. On native Windows:
    ```
    .\Debug\sick_generic_caller.exe ../launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch hostname:=127.0.0.1 sw_pll_only_publish:=False
    ```
    On Windows with ROS-2:
    ```
    ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch hostname:=127.0.0.1 sw_pll_only_publish:=False
    ```

3. Open file `image_viewer.html` in folder `demo` in your browser to view a jpg-image of the current scan.

Note, that python version 3 incl. runtime dlls must be accessable, f.e. by extending the PATH environment variable:
```
set PYTHON_DIR=%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Microsoft Visual Studio/Shared/Python37_64
set PATH=%PYTHON_DIR%;%PYTHON_DIR%/Scripts;c:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin;%PATH%
```

Further examples are provided in folder `test/scripts`.

### Simulation on Linux

Run script `run_simu_lms_5xx.bash` in folder `test/scripts` or execute the following commands:

1. Start the test server:
    ```
    python3 ./test/emulator/test_server.py --scandata_file=./test/emulator/scandata/20210302_lms511.pcapng.scandata.txt --scandata_frequency=20.0 --tcp_port=2112 &
    sleep 1
    ```

2. Run sick_generic_caller.
    - On native Linux:
         ```
        ./build/sick_generic_caller ./launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch hostname:=127.0.0.1 sw_pll_only_publish:=False &
        ```
    - On Linux with ROS-1:
         ```
        roslaunch sick_scan sick_lms_5xx.launch hostname:=127.0.0.1 sw_pll_only_publish:=False &
        ```
    - On Linux with ROS-2:
         ```
        ros2 run sick_scan sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch hostname:=127.0.0.1 sw_pll_only_publish:=False &
        ```

3. View the point cloud.
    - On native Linux:<br>
         Open file `image_viewer.html` in folder `demo` in a browser (f.e. firefox) to view a jpg-image of the current scan.
    - On Linux with ROS-1:
         ```
        rosrun rviz rviz -d ./src/sick_scan_xd/test/emulator/config/rviz_emulator_cfg_lms5xx.rviz &
        ```
    - On Linux with ROS-2:
         ```
        rviz2 -d ./src/sick_scan_xd/test/emulator/config/rviz2_lms5xx.rviz &
        ```

Further examples are provided in folder `test/scripts`.
