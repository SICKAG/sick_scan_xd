* Merge pull request `#10 <https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/issues/10>`_ from hatchbed/fix-build-type
  Fix ROS 1 build
* Fix ROS 1 build
  catkin_make was refusing to build this package because it couldn't
  identify the build type, so this explicitly sets the build_type to
  catkin when in a ROS 1 environment.
  Also, there was a header that was defining some values that should
  only be set in ROS 2, and the #if definition around it was accidentally
  checking if the ROS version was >0 rather than >1, so this also fixes
  that.
* ROS1/ROS2-compatibility
* Merge pull request `#2 <https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/issues/2>`_ from hatchbed/consolidate-package-manifests
  Consolidate ROS 1 & ROS 2 package manifests
* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/issues/3>`_ from hatchbed/1/fix-dynamic-reconfig-permissions

* adding lms_1xx_ros1.rviz file
* fixed mrs 6000 ang offset
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/devel'
* radar info. updated
* added multi echo support for LMS 5xx
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into devel
* finshed LRS 36x0 and LRS 36x1 support
* Update README.md
  fixes `#7 <https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/issues/7>`_
* Fix dynamic reconfig permissions
  The .cfg files used to provide dynamic reconfigure support in ROS 1
  are executable Python files, and so they need to have the executable
  bit set in order to work properly.
  Fixes `#1 <https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/issues/1>`_
* Update README.md
* Consolidate ROS 1 & ROS 2 package manifests
  Previously, this package had separate package manifest files for ROS 1 and ROS 2, and it was necessary to run a script after cloning the repository to name the correct one package.xml.
  This consolidates both of them into a single package.xml file that works with both ROS 1 and ROS 2, so the package can now be cloned and built inside a standard colcon workspace without needing to run any additional scripts.  It also makes a few tweaks to other files to ensure compatibility.
  This has been tested on ROS Noetic and ROS Foxy in Ubuntu 20.04.
